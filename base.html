                    <h3>Principal Data Scientist</h3>
                    My journey at Flipkart has been one of learning and excitement! Having been a part of the company’s
                    hyper-growth phase, I feel like what you learn at Flipkart in one year would take many years
                    outside! When I joined Flipkart, our data science team was quite small. It’s been very fulfilling
                    and rewarding to watch the team grow and have a huge impact on so many aspects of business, while
                    still retaining a sense of one community – which has always been the hallmark of teams at Flipkart!

                I’ve been a part of Flipkart’s Product Management Group for 8 years and come to work every day to
                participate in this incredible transformation of the E-Commerce industry through tech and product
                disruptions! As we solve for the Next 200 Million customers, the smart and talented peer group, culture
                of ownership and emphasis on meritocracy work as strong stimulants for personal as well as

            Working at Flipkart provides you with challenging problems and milestones, competent peers and transparent
            work environment – every day! I loved it so much that I actually took the Flipkart journey twice! In both my
            stints, I had the opportunity to solve for big challenges right from bank integrations to revamping the
            entire tech stack for Retail. Flipkart’s culture allows you to navigate across many different roles across
            different teams, and that’s great for holistic development!

            As a product manager, it’s really heartening to see that customer-centricity cuts across all the work we do
            and is ingrained in each Flipster! The company moves fast but doesn’t compromise, and it’s a great feeling
            to watch customers being delighted with the products that you build! From my ﬁrst day, I’ve been working
            with the brightest minds and solving the unique and challenging problems of Indian e-commerce at scale!
